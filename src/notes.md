# Project Knights Travails Notes

## 2023-06-18

- [x] put together a script that creates a game board and a knight

- [x] Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.

Made some functions to represent possible moves in tree as new nodes.
I would like to build a full tree from the starting position first

Some observations:
If a knight moves from one position to another, it seems you can usually dismiss nodes left or right, depending on direction

- [x] build full tree

now I'd like to first find out at which level my desired value can be found
But before I do so, first remove duplicates from the items to be turned into nodes

Recursive buildTree is acting a bit funny after a few steps. It starts removing visited nodes so I'll have to go trough that one for a bit and refactor the base array creators to see where the bug sneaked in. 

I refactored the comparison function to return the gameboard and this fixed the issue but now it renders each option and doesn't skip the ones already visited

decided to restart for my end goal is being able to do a BFS which means I don't need to render the full tree perse. 

First steps:
- [ ] check gameboard to see if array is all good and if it needs refactoring
- [ ] hardcode a starting position and an end position being next to eachother
- [ ] create a queue function for the BFS
  - [ ] if current node does not equal goal: generate children and see if the goal is in there
